- more than 4 blocks in 4x4 thing					
- a "not empty" block isnt touching another
- anything else than "filled char" and "empty char"	\\Done
- 4x4 separateed with 1 newline						\\Done
- Add gnl to libft
- static functions
- better logic in which files functions are

Main
*	part1 (read how many tetriminos in the file) returns (-1: too many line breaks)(-2: not 4x4)(x: == how_many tetriminos)
**		getnl
*	part2 (puts all the tetriminos in a 2d array) returns (char **) new 2d arr (willl not be called if part1 didnt function)
**		getnl
*	?Validity? (checks if all tetriminos are valid) returns (0: one of the checks didnt pass)(1: all checks passed)
*	pre_rec	(?) return (?)
**		makenewblock (makes a NxN map filled with emptychars) returns (char **) new 2d arr 
**		recursive (?) returns (?)
***			actualinsert
****			insertomap (moves all blocks to the top left) returns (char **) new 2d arr of block
****			getfirstincertable //TODO: start from 0,0 and check if its empty if is try to insert if not go next
									(?) returns (int *) coords of first emptychar in 2d arr map
